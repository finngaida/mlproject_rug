# ML Project: Bike recognition
By Lennart, Niels, Rohit, Finn

---

## Overview
In the recent years, automatically analyzing traffic streams has become more and more popular. There seem to be many cases in which a system capable of recognizing traffic participants could be used. One of these cases was suggested by the [Gemeente Groningen](https://www.rtvnoord.nl/nieuws/201369/Stad-roept-hulp-bedrijven-in-bij-oplossen-drukte-fietsers-en-voetgangers). The city counsil would like to analyze the amount of cyclists and pedestrians using cameras. We believe this problem could be solved using machine learning. For our project we will try to come as close to an actual solution for this problem as possible, while prioritizing the machine learning aspect over the deployment of a live system.
